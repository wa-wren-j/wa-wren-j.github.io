                <h3>Client Requests</h3>
                <p>
                    When I started this, I first asked the client what they wanted; any colour choices, and specific layouts they liked, what they wanted to showcase the most, etc. After talking through it, we came up with this short list:
                <ul>
                    <li>A maroon and yellow colour scheme</li>
                    <li>To showcase the multiple types of jobs they do</li>
                    <li>To fix up the wording and update old or irrelevant information</li>
                </ul>
                And yes, before you ask, the last name isn't a coincidence, this is my father's website. When I first told him I was getting into UX and Web Design he asked me to design/redesign his website and I told him I would (it's been a few years since then). <strong>This in no way influenced my design process.</strong>
                </p>

                <br>

                <h3>Before</h3>
                <p>
                    The website before I got to it was full of weird spacing and wording, as well as old and/or redundant information that needed to be updated. The general design was also a little dated, and there were a lot of pages that could have been condensed or cut completely.

                <h3>Process</h3>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately I wasn't able to get access to the original files for this site, so I had to start from scratch in a blank HTML file. After giving it the barebones, I started to add in all the information that was being brought to the new site and leaving the info that wasn't. I could and did update it after. I looked for inspiration and references at other general contracting websites and pulled pieces from them into my own design.
                    <br><br>
                    I played around with a lot of different fonts in order to make a simple logo, and brought a selection to the client for feedback, which were then made into the final logo (rejected fonts are on a red background, fonts brought to the client are on a yellow background). Given more time and resources, I could have made a more in-depth and better designed logo for this client, but this will serve as a nice placeholder.
                </p>
                <br>
                <div id="col-1">
                    <a href="assets/dadsite/logos.PNG" target="_blank">
                        <img src="assets/dadsite/logos.PNG">
                    </a>
                </div>
                <br>
                <p>
                    With that all in place it was a matter of making sure the grid of what jobs are available was responsive to different screen sizes, putting in all the images and adjusting the colours and font sizes. I also added in a better gallery of images of the client's previous work, which doubled as a nice way to help break up the monotony of the page.
                </p>

                <br>

                <h3>After</h3>

                <p>
                    First and foremost the multiple pages were combined into a single page with all relevant information for easier access. I also talked to the client and removed all the old information and either replaced it or updated it so it's relevant, consistent and accurate. For instance, the client no longer works with furnaces and heating, so all the information relevant to that had to be cut and replaced by general contracting information.
                    <br><br>
                    It's a very basic webpage, but I feel it provides a better and more conscise experience than the previous one (image opens in new tab).
