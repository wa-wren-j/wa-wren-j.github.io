                        This was the sum of about four months of hard work done by two of my peers and I. We were tasked to create a narrative with physical artifacts based on a Greek myth - we chose Pandora and the Box.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <br>

                <h3>Define</h3>
                <p>
                    We took a long time to come to an agreement on where we wanted to take the story. We'd brainstormed and suggested different myths and almost immediately decided on Pandora, but after that, we had too many ideas. It was difficult for us to settle with just one.
                    <br><br>
                    Eventually we settled on time travel, and the theme of inevitablility. Specifically the idea that sometimes, no matter what you do to change it, the outcome will always be the same. Once that was established, we immediately jumped into crafting our narrative, which was a mistake on our part because it was far too early for that; we were thinking about characters and plot points and possible good and bad endings instead of how we should proceed and get the idea off the ground.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h3>Ideate</h3>
                <p>
                    Our final chosen themes were the Dangers/Consequences of Knowledge, the Dangers of Curiousity, Evil is Inevitable (no matter how it's caused) and Focusing on the Present Instead of the Past.
                    <br><br>

                    We agreed that our story would only have one ending, and that it wouldn't be a happy one. Sometimes the world is just like that, unfortunately.
                    <br><br>
                    We wanted the final project to be a game. The player would be a time traveller recruited by a government agency. They would travel back in time in an effort to stop WWIII by infiltrating a top secret government base. During the mission, the traveller accidentally triggers a silent alarm and sends the base into high alert. In the chaos, a missile gets launched that ends up starting the war.
                    <br><br>
                    Unfortunately for the player - no matter how many times they play, or how many different choices they make - it's their very interference itself that causes WWIII in the first place.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h3>Prototype</h3>
                <p>
                    One of our challenges was to have 6 different artifacts, either physical or digital, but at least one had to be physical. We agonized over what to make an artifact and thought about player interaction and how well we could integrate certain things into our story.
                    <br><br>
                    We decided to have a scannable keycard, a map of the base, a recruitment poster from the government agency that the player works for, the story itself counted as a digital artifact, and two newspapers - one from before the player goes back in time and one from after, which had slight alterations.
                    <br><br>
                    Flip through the gallery below to see the artifacts.

                <h3>Test</h3>
                <p>
                    Over the course of about three weeks, we launched our game and let players give us feedback, as well as colelcted some data through Google Analytics. We recieved multiple accounts of valuable feedback and changed a few things accordingly:
                    <br><br><br>
                    Players found the secret code at the beginning a bit too hard to figure out, so we made it a bit easier for them.
                    <br><br>
                    Players were skipping over the newspaper at the end because it didn't look different enough from the one at the beginning, so we added some prompts that highlighted that there was a change.
                    <br><br>
                    Some players were having trouble with using certain browsers, so we tried to fix any bugs best we could and for those we couldn't, added a 'recommeneded browser' note before the game starts.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h3>The Final Piece</h3>
                <p>
                    Overall, we're very proud of our little game and how far it's come. We've put countless hours of hard work into it and the outcome is something we feel happy to share with others. We'll be able to carry the knowledge we've gained from working on this project with us into the future and apply it to other aspects of our careers, which is all we can hope for when doing big collaborative projects like this, especially if they don't work out. Learning never stops.
