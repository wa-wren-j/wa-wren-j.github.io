                <h3>Define</h3>
                <p>
                    This project was a collaboration between multiple teams and <a href="https://www.redthreadinnovations.com/">Red Thread Innovations.</a> At first, they gave us four months to think of an idea space and convince them why it should be the space the teams would all ideate a digital solution for. In the end, teams could choose between Healthcare in Rural Spaces, or Workplace Wellness.
                    <br><br>
                    Our team chose Workplace Wellness, but since we needed to create a digital solution to the problem, we had to think about which workplaces would benefit from that type of solution, and which careers and jobs would both make use of and have access to our solution. We decided that burnout was a huge problem, and focused in on that aspect.
                    <br><br>
                    Office workers were deemed the best choice of user for our solution, as they experience periods of burnout and could have reliable access to our solution.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h3>Ideate</h3>
                <p>
                    Once we had our users in mind, we needed to think about what the solution would actually do for them. What's the link between burnout and office workers? Why is it happening, what types of things relieve it, can it be prevented?
                    <br><br>
                    Originally, we were going to design a program that would remind the user when it was time to take a break, take a drink, get a snack, etc. It would chime in every so often to help them take better care of themselves and thus prevent burnout.
                    <br><br>
                    While talking to the head of our side of the project, he mentioned that some employees have access to benefits such as massages or an in-house cafeteria, and to try and make use of that. We talked about it after thanking him, and had the relevation about employee benefits - one of our team members said she could never keep her benefits straight and didn't actually know which benefits she had and didn't, nor when they expire or renew, if they did at all. We immediately called our project leader back and pitched this new idea to him, to great success and praise.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h3>Prototype</h3>
                <p>
                    Our new idea was a system that kept track of the user's benefits (such as total money allocated for dental, what their health insurance covers, etc) all in one place. It would show when the renewal dates were, how many times you've used a benefit, among several other things.
                    <br><br>
                    The project didn't require us to design the full product, only up until we could have a solid pitch. We decided to mock up the onboarding process, as that would be the most important part. If it wasn't easy to add your benefits to the program, then what was the point?
                    <br><br>
                    Check out our prototype below:
                </p>

                <p>
                    As this was still a prototype, we barely had a brand style, and we didn't even have a name for the whole thing yet, so we just came up with something quick and put some placceholders in.
